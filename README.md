# README

Status documentation can be found in /docs; notably [TODO.md](/docs/TODO.md) and [CURRENT.md](/docs/CURRENT.md). CURRENT describes current tasks to address; TODO describes more long-range tasks. Additionally, `TODO:` comments injected in the code indicate hotzones: obvious bugs, edge cases, and potentially un-idiomatic uses that could bear to be refactored.

## Whiteboard

This project is an implementation of a simple Learning Management System in Rails and (eventually) Backbone/JS. It takes inspiration from Blackboard primarily, although there are a number of similar LMSes out in the wild, none of which draw particular love and adoration from its users.

Additionally, this project takes inspiration from the AppAcademy progress tracker. However, where AA's Progress Tracker is a bespoke combination of github `gist`s/sundry markdown, external links, Google groups, Tumblr, and other pieces, this site aims to combine these into a single location.

Think: learning, gradebook, collaboration, etc all in one place.
