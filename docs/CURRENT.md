* Implement CompositeView
* Static page


---
Notes
* Rails /views handles static views
* Rails /views/api contains json.jbuilder files
* Keep in mind that if you want consistency, extend a custom view that contains default key handlers, etc.

* Calendar can have router without needing a model
* So can roster, etc.
