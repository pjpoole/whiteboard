A course doesn't have to be tied to any dates or even simultaneous enrollments

At the most rigid, an Institution has many Programs, which have Courses. Instances of these courses, Classes, meet during specific Terms, using specific Resources (rooms, etc). When a Student has completed a number of classes with requisite Grades, the student will be deemed to have achieved a Degree in the Program.

At the most flexible, a person will create a Class which will have attached resources, and which students can enroll in and complete. They will be the de facto Instructor but that will mostly entail collecting resources and composing the curriculum.

An Enrollment is the primary identifier for grading and attendance.
